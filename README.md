# Risky-bank-clients-identification-with-unsupervised-method
This work is a project cooperating with ATB bank. It is to identify the risky clients based on the clients’ transaction history. Risky clients represent the clients who are going to default on a loan or debt. Our team is required to use an unsupervised method to do this work. First of all, we do the feature engineering on the data. For example, we filled the null with the average of their columns and then we normalize it to eliminate the features’ difference in scale. And then we use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data. It is reduced from 1200 features to around 200 features. This can improve the efficiency a lot. Next, we select two kinds of popular unsupervised models including the clustering models like K-means and probabilistic models like GMM. Cross-validation is used to tune the parameters in the training process. Lastly, Silhouette coefficient is used to evaluate clustering models. While log-likelihood is used to evaluate the probabilistic models. The best model we find is the GMM model. It can identify the risky proportion around 28%.
